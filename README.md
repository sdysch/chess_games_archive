Downloading and storing my monthly chess.com game archives

## TODO
- [ ] dump into SQL database
- [ ] Figure out the weird opponent vs player results (both win, both resign??)
- [ ] Parse and save:
	- [ ] opening name (ECO)
	- [ ] date
	- [ ] unique game ID, so I don't try and add the same game into SQL database. Maybe hash the game URL?
